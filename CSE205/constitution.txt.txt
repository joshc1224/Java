[299]Letter of Transmittal to the President of Congress
[300]skip to Amendments   up to Letter of Transmittal
[301]In Convention.  Monday September 17th 1787.
[302]SIR: 
[303]
[304]We have now the honor to submit to the consideration of the United States in Congress assembled, that Constitution which has appeared to us the most advisable. 
[305]
[306]The friends of our country have long seen and desired that the power of making war, peace, and treaties, that of levying money, and regulating commerce, and the correspondent executive and judicial authorities, should be fully and effectually vested in the General Government of the Union; but the impropriety of delegating such extensive trust to one body of men is evident: hence results the necessity of a different organization. 
[307]
[308]It is obviously impracticable in the Federal Government of these States to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all. Individuals entering into society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and circumstance, as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which must be surrendered, and those which may be preserved; and, on the present occasion, this difficulty was increased by a difference among the several States as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular interests. 
[309]
[310]In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our view that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true American, the consolidation of our Union, in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety—perhaps our national existence. This important consideration, seriously and deeply impressed on our minds, led each State in the Convention to be less rigid on points of inferior magnitude than might have been otherwise expected; and thus, the Constitution which we now present is the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession, which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable. 
[311]
[312]That it will meet the full and entire approbation of every State is not, perhaps, to be expected; but each will, doubtless, consider, that had her interest alone been consulted, the consequences might have been particularly disagreeable or injurious to others; that it is liable to as few exceptions as could reasonably have been expected, we hope and believe; that it may promote the lasting welfare of that Country so dear to us all, and secure her freedom and happiness, is our most ardent wish. 
[313]
[314]    With great respect,
[315]    we have the honor to be,
[316]        SIR,
[317]      your excellency's most obedient and humble servants: 
[318]    GEORGE WASHINGTON, President.
[319]  By the unanimous order of the convention.
[320]
[321]His Excellency
[322]  the President of Congress.

[695]How to read Roman numerals:
[696]The upper case letter I represents the arabic 1.
[697]The upper case letter V represents the arabic 5.
[698]The upper case letter X represents the arabic 10.
[699]The upper case letter L represents the arabic 50. (not used in this document)
[700]The upper case letter C represents the arabic 100. (not used in this document)
[701]The upper case letter D represents the arabic 500. (not used in this document)
[702]The upper case letter M represents the arabic 1,000. (not used in this document)
[703]A bar placed over a letter or group of letters multiplies that value by 1,000. (not used in this document)
[704]If the letter to the right represents an equal or smaller value the numbers ADD. XXII is 22.
[705]If the letter to the right is a larger value then the numbers SUBTRACT. IV is 4. Only I is used with V or X, X with L or C, and C with D or M.
[706]There is no zero!
[707]Both C and M often still appear in commerce mixed with arabic therefore if someone orders a quantity of 5M, they want 5,000 not 5 million.
[708]A few more samples: XCV = 95, XIII = 13, XCIX = 99, XLIX = 49
[709]If supported in the browser, hovering the cursor over the Roman number in this document will display the arabic equivalent for a short time.

[767]Some features are browser dependent.
[768]Historic spellings, punctuation, hyphenation and grammar are retained. A spelling list is provide and in most browsers simply placing the cursor over the word will bring up the current spelling for a short time.
[769]Some words are not in everyday vocabulary. A vocabulary list is provide and in most browsers simply placing the cursor over the word or phrase will bring up an alternative for a short time.
[770]The division into clauses, not in the original, makes it easier to reference specific portions of the document allowing both an internal index and for use by external web pages such as teachers guide, or to emphasize a point of a given political point of view in a web page or email.
[771]Placing the cursor over a article number will display the article number as arabic and to what the article pertains.
[772]Placing the cursor over a section number will display the article and section number and to what the section pertains.
[773]Placing the cursor over a clause number will display the article, section and clause number and to what the clause pertains. Note: Sections with a single clause have no clause number. If clause numbers are hidden just hover over the first letter of the clause.
[774]If the hover feature is not available the short title of the article, section, or clause is listed in the index.
[775]Some documents call the division of amendments sections, others clauses, amendment 20 refers to its divisions as sections. They will be called sections in this document.
[776]The title attribute (not to be confused with the <TITLE> tag) used in this document in an attempt to provide quick vocabulary, spelling, heading group short titles, and other helps has been defined as a part of the Hyper Text Markup Language from its earliest days in the Anchor and LINK tags. The proper handling was suggested in 1997 with this handling repeated as part of the HTML 4.0 (and added to most tag types) later in the same year from the W3C. If the browser does not support this (i.e. Safari 1.1.1 v100.1 and before only work in clickable links, others - see table below) then most of the same information is duplicated in various sections such as spelling list, index and vocabulary list including how to read roman numerals.
[777]Footnotes are links displayed as superscripted arabic numbers (superior figures) and the text that they modify are displayed in a gray when using the normal stylesheet. Gray was chosen to leave the text readable as opposed to strikeout
[778]The punctuation around articles and section numbers have been removed since this practice has fallen into disuse and adds little to the feel of this version. (Article. I. becomes Article I)
[779]Article 1 Section 9 Clause 1 - Importation of Slaves; is shown as no longer in effect since its built in date has passed.
[780]Most transcriptions show the "Attest 'William Jackson' Secretary" at the end of the other signatures as if validating those. This one shows that he, more likely, was attesting to the document itself or possibly the list of corrections in the document.
[781]The Bill of Rights had twelve numbered articles but only ten were ratified. Since they were renumbered only the two unratified, which are shown in gray, are shown with the original number (as in Article the first) to try to avoid confusion.
[782]A note for anyone looking at the image of the Bill of Rights above or any document of a similar period is the usage of an elongated s that can often be confused with the letter f. The typical usage rules in this period seem to be that the elongated s is the main lower case s unless at the end of a word or the second s of a pair. Today the elongated s ( ? ) is typically only used in mathematical formulae as the notation for integral. There is a story that Shakespeare who spelled his own name Shakspere or Shakspeare gained the extra e when a typesetter had trouble fitting the elongated s next to the k.

[785]Why another web version?
[786]Yes there are about 2,000 or so online versions. And about a 100 times that as partial versions. The better of some of the others are listed above in Sources.
[787]This is built for ease of use. With the built-in vocabulary it's hoped that it can be used as well by kids, and those for which english is not the first language with a minimum of outside reference.
[788]This is all loaded in one page. The Constitution, Amendments (including the Bill of Rights), Notes, spellings, vocabulary, index, ratifications for simpler browsing. Though it may take up to a minute to fully load with a slow modem connection, there is no reload time going from section to section.
[789]This attempts to stay out of the way while reading but bring quick access to notations, vocabulary, and spelling variations as well as ratifications.
[790]You may read it the way you like. Top to bottom. Jumping from Articles to Amendments that modify them to ratification information in any order.
[791]Other than the vocabulary it is offered very deliberately without interpretation.
[792]It is usable without style sheets as well as supplying a standard and two low vision style sheets.
[793]Supplies links so that anyone can point to a section, clause or amendment for someone else to be able to see in context with annotation available to that reader.

[801]This is a privately owned page and not required to meet any guidelines, however:
[802]An attempt has been made to provide additional accessibility to this important document.
[803]Basic web standards are used. In addition it has been checked for U.S. Section 508 compliance with Cynthia Saystm Portal
[804]Some of the challenges that may still be present are:
[805]Historic spellings are retained. For visual users both a section presenting a list of historic and current spellings is given and in most modern visual user agents (browsers) simply hovering the cursor over the word will bring up the current spelling for a short time. Aural (voice) agents may or may not have difficulty.
[806]Some words are not in everyday vocabulary. The method is the same as for spelling.
[807]Historic grammar, punctuation and hyphenation are retained.
[808]The division into clauses, not in the original, while making it easier to reference specific portions of the document may make the straight reading of the document somewhat more tedious. These can be hidden if the browser will support the “Hide clause #s” button above.
[809]Basic font size setting is left at browser setting in the preferred screen style sheet, doubled in the low vision screen style sheet.
[810]A very low vision screen style sheet provides white on black and fonts 4x default size.
[811]The hovering the cursor feature does not have any way of changing the displayed font size in any presently known browser nor does any style sheet standard have a setting for this purpose.

[1303]The Constitution
[1304]The Constitution was adopted by a convention of the States on September 17, 1787, and was subsequently ratified by the several States, on the following dates:  Delaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; New Jersey, December 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788.
[1305]
[1306]Ratification was completed on June 21, 1788.
[1307]
[1308]The Constitution was subsequently ratified by Virginia, June 25, 1788; New York, July 26, 1788; North Carolina, November 21, 1789; Rhode Island, May 29, 1790; and Vermont, January 10, 1791.
[1309]
[1310]In May 1785, a committee of Congress made a report recommending an alteration in the Articles of Confederation, but no action was taken on it, and it was left to the State Legislatures to proceed in the matter. In January 1786, the Legislature of Virginia passed a resolution providing for the appointment of five commissioners, who, or any three of them, should meet such commissioners as might be appointed in the other States of the Union, at a time and place to be agreed upon, to take into consideration the trade of the United States; to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony; and to report to the several States such an act, relative to this great object, as, when ratified by them, will enable the United States in Congress effectually to provide for the same. The Virginia commissioners, after some correspondence, fixed the first Monday in September as the time, and the city of Annapolis as the place for the meeting, but only four other States were represented, viz:  Delaware, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; the commissioners appointed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Rhode Island failed to attend. Under the circumstances of so partial a representation, the commissioners present agreed upon a report, (drawn by Mr. Hamilton, of New York,) expressing their unanimous conviction that it might essentially tend to advance the interests of the Union if the States by which they were respectively delegated would concur, and use their endeavors to procure the concurrence of the other States, in the appointment of commissioners to meet at Philadelphia on the Second Monday of May following, to take into consideration the situation of the United States; to devise such further provisions as should appear to them necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the Union; and to report such an act for that purpose to the United States in Congress assembled as, when agreed to by them and afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State, would effectually provide for the same.
[1311]
[1312]Congress, on the 21st of February, 1787, adopted a resolution in favor of a convention, and the Legislatures of those States which had not already done so (with the exception of Rhode Island) promptly appointed delegates. On the 25th of May, seven States having convened, George Washington, of Virginia, was unanimously elected President, and the consideration of the proposed constitution was commenced. On the 17th of September, 1787, the Constitution as engrossed and agreed upon was signed by all the members present, except Mr. Gerry of Massachusetts, and Messrs. Mason and Randolph, of Virginia. The president of the convention transmitted it to Congress, with a resolution stating how the proposed Federal Government should be put in operation, and an explanatory letter. Congress, on the 28th of September, 1787, directed the Constitution so framed, with the resolutions and letter concerning the same, to “be transmitted to the several Legislatures in order to be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each State by the people thereof, in conformity to the resolves of the convention.”
[1313]
[1314]On the 4th of March, 1789, the day which had been fixed for commencing the operations of Government under the new Constitution, it had been ratified by the conventions chosen in each State to consider it, as follows:  Delaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; New Jersey, December 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; Virginia, June 25, 1788; and New York, July 26, 1788.
[1315]
[1316]The President informed Congress, on the 28th of January, 1790, that North Carolina had ratified the Constitution November 21, 1789; and he informed Congress on the 1st of June, 1790, that Rhode Island had ratified the Constitution May 29, 1790. Vermont, in convention, ratified the Constitution January 10, 1791, and was, by an act of Congress approved February 18, 1791, “received and admitted into this Union as a new and entire member of the United States”.
